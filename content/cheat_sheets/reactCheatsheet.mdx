If you're reading this, you probably are already using React so I won't bore you into a description of what it is. If you don't find what you're looking for here, just read the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://react.dev/reference/react/">official docs</a>.


## <a id="map"></a>Mapping over data

Adding keys to children in a list helps react keep track of stuff. I can help with performance.


```jsx
const data = [
    {
        title: "My first blog post",
        abstract: "This is the abstract of my first blog post.",
        date: "2024-02-09T12:00:00-0400"
    },
    {
        title: "My second blog post",
        abstract: "This is the abstract of my second blog post.",
        date: "2024-02-09T12:00:00-0400"
    }
];

function MyComponent() {
    return (
        <ul>
        {data.map((blogPost) => {
            <ContactCard
            key={Crypto.randomUUID()} // could be blogPost.id if you have one
            title={blogPost.title}
            abstract={blogPost.abstract}
            date={blogPost.date}
        />
        })}
    </ul>
    );
}
```

If you forget the key prop you'll get this beautiful warning:

```
Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
```

Take note, they are not global. You can implement the same key in different lists.

Theres a milions ways to do this. A lot of them have drawbacks. Here's some options.

### If else

Only good if there is two options. But don't use it, it's kind of bad. Having two return makes things harder to understand.

```jsx
function Person({ name, isDead }) {
    if(isDead) {
        return <Obituary name={name} />
    } else {
        return <Bio name={name} />
    }
}
```

### Ternary operator

Again, only good if there is two options. **Don't nest ternaries**!

```jsx
function Person({ name, isDead }) {
    return (
        isDead ? <Obituary name={name} /> : <Bio name={name} />
    )
}
```

### The && operator

Pretty much always the go-to.

```jsx
function Person({ name, isDead }) {
    return (
        <>
            {isDead && <Obituary name={name} />}
            {!isDead && <Bio name={name} />}
        </>
    )
}
```

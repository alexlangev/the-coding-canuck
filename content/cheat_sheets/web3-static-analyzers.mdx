## <a id="what"></a>What are static analyzers

A **static analyzer** is simply a program that looks at code **without executing it**. It is often used in _CI/CD workflows_, _code reviews_ and _security audits_. In this cheatsheet, we'll look at two different analyzers commonly used in security audits of Solidity codebases.

**Slither** is a static analyzer for **Solidity** and **Vyper** smart contracts. It has been developed by the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.trailofbits.com/">Trail Of Bits</a> team. It runs a suite of vulnerability detectors and prints out a report your terminal.

For more information, go to their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/crytic/slither">github page</a>.

### Installation

#### Using Pip

The easiest way to intall **Slither** is using **pip** with:

```bash
pip3 install slither-analyzer
```

#### Using git or docker

Refer to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/crytic/slither?tab=readme-ov-file#using-git">this</a> for the instructions.

### Basic usage

Run **Slither** in the root directory of a Hardhat/Foundry/Dapp/Brownie application. This is the **preferred option** if your project has dependencies as **Slither** relies on the underlying compilation framework to compile source code.

```bash
slither .
```

Otherwise, you can run **Slither** on a single file that does not import dependencies with:

```bash
slither tests/uninitialized.sol
```

To use Slither without relying on a framework, you'll need to install <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/crytic/solc-select">solc-select</a> which is a Solidity compiler and version manager combined.

### Path filtering

You might need to limit the scope to a few contracts or skip the analysis of certain libraries. For this, you can use `--filter-paths path1`. It will exclude all of the results that are only related to path1. The path specified can be a _path directory or a filename_. Direct string comparison and Python regular expression are used.

Filter all contracts in the `lib` directory with:

```bash
slither . --filter-paths "lib"
```

Filter all contracts in the 'lib/openzeppelin-contracts' directory with:

```bash
slither . --filter-paths "openzeppelin-contracts"
```

Filter all the results only related to the file SafeMath.sol or ConvertLib.sol with:

```bash
slither . --filter-paths "Migrations.sol|ConvertLib.sol"
```

### High level overview

**Slither** can produce a high level overview of the codebase with:

```bash
slither . --print human-summary
```

### Create inheritance graph

**Slither** can output an **inheritance graph**. The first command outputs a `inheritance-graph.dot` file in the current directory. The second outputs a `examples/printers/inheritances.sol.dot` file in the current directory.

```bash
slither . --print inheritance-graph
slither examples/printers/inheritances.sol --print inheritance-graph
```

To visualize the file you'll need the help of `xdot` with:

```bash
xdot examples/printers/inheritances.sol.dot
```

## <a id="aderyn"></a>Aderyn

![aderyn logo](/images/aderyn_logo.png "Aderyn Logo")

**Aderyn** is a static analyzer created by the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cyfrin.io/">Cyfrin</a>
team. It is compatible with both hardhat and foundry. It produces a .md report. At the time of writing, it is not as good as slither. That being said, it's being developed actively compared to **Slither**.

For more information look at their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Cyfrin/aderyn">github page</a>.

### Installation

To install **Aderyn** you need to have Rust and cargo installed. you can do this with the following:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Once you have the dependencies installed, you can install **Aderyn** with cargo with the following command:

```bash
cargo install aderyn
```

### Usage

You can run **Aderyn** on all files of the current working directory with:

```bash
aderyn .
```

You can also run it on a single file:

```bash
aderyn src/MyContract.sol
```
